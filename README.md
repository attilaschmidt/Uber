1) Create a generic class that reproduces the functionality of a "Roll-up Summary" field (sums up any numeric field of its child records and places the value on the parent). Remember, this class should be reusable by any object triggers for any specified field by the developer.

2) Use the generic class you have built within the Opportunity Trigger to roll up the Amount field on all Open Opportunities and store it in an Account field called "Total Pipeline".
